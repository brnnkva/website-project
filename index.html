          <h4>
            Festivals
          </h4>
          <p>
            China’s history and culture are on full display in the festivals and holidays that Chinese people celebrate throughout the year. 
            Most Chinese holidays are festive, and all of them involve family. 
            Here is a short list of a few major holidays in China.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Chinese New Year
              <br />
              Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival.
              This holiday is the most important of all Chinese holidays. 
              Since it’s based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar, the actual date varies from year to year, but it’s usually celebrated in late January or early February.
              During Spring Festival, there’s a strong focus on ensuring good luck for the upcoming year. 
              People should avoid the unlucky number four (四 sì) during this time, as its spoken form sounds similar to the word for death (死 sǐ).

              Tomb Sweeping Day
              <br />
              Qingming Festival, also called the Pure Brightness Festival or Tomb-Sweeping Day. 
              Dating back 2,500 years, Qingming Festival symbolizes the Chinese people’s deep-rooted respect for their ancestors.
              On this day, Chinese families traditionally visit their ancestors’ tombs to clear and sweep them. 
              Qingming Festival falls on the 15th day after the Spring Equinox, which can be either April 4th, 5th or 6th in any given year.
              Many also burn offerings of imitation paper money, also known as “hell money,” on or near their ancestors’ tombs so that their loved ones can make purchases in the afterlife.

            <li>
              Lantern Festival
              <br />
              The festival is a Chinese holiday that traditionally marks the end of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) celebrations.
              Chinese people celebrate this holiday by enjoying colored lantern displays and eating sweet rice balls called tangyuan. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Dragon Boat Festival 
              <br />
              There are two common origin stories for the Dragon Boat Festival: one is superstitious, and the other historic.
              The fifth month of the year is considered bad luck, especially on its fifth day. 
              Thus, one legend says that the festival was born to keep bad luck and evil spirits away.
              However, the best-known legend behind the festival is that it commemorates the death of Qu Yuan, a poet and politician.
              Legend says that Qu Yuan was accused of treason and banished from political office. 
              In despair, he committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River. 
              He was popular with the local people, and after his death, they rushed to their boats to save him or at least recover his body.
              This is the origin of the festival’s most famous activity: dragon boat races.
